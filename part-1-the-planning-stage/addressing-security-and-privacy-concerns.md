# Addressing security and privacy concerns

First, you need to make clear to tipsters what you are going to do with their information. In the case of DocHate, we say that their information is confidential, but we do explain that the tips they send will be shared with other journalists that are part of the project. In our case, participating journalists can only see contact information for tips that came in through their form; otherwise, they have to request contact information through the partner manager. You may need to repeat some of this information when you reach out to tipsters, because they don't always read through the page when they submit tips.

We're creating a turnkey database solution that will also have specific security protocols. But if you build your own database, setting up levels of security to ensure only authorized users can access it are important.
