# Why collaborate?

Stefanie Murray, the director of the Center for Cooperative Media and an expert on journalism collaborations, says five of the most common ways collaborative projects start are based on: an upcoming event a looming crisis someone who starts a conversation about enterprise topics someone who's having trouble cracking a story on their own someone who received resources or funding.

Murray recommends that when considering partners, you will want to evaluate the need for help with the following areas: Reporting Records requests Distribution Data analysis The ability to expand the scope of the project.

"There's many many reasons that you might seek a partner, but it's important to think about why," she says.

Heather Bryant, founder and director of Project Facet, a platform for journalism collaborations, says that it's important that partners recognize each other's different motivations from the beginning of the planning process, and that clearly communicating goals, roles and expectations is key.

"I found that the groups that have really made it work are the ones that have doubled down on the effort to clearly communicate with everybody and try to meet people where they are and ensure that everybody knows what's going on," she said. "I feel like any effort you invest in communicating and making sure that everybody who's participating is informed is a value you definitely get a return on."

Once you agree to a partnership, Murray's recommendation is that all parties consider the following: Will you produce content separately and share it? Will you feed into a shared data set that you use to do reporting independently? Will you analyze data together and combine reporting resources? What shared language will you use? How will this be funded? Will you use shared images or logos? How will the editing process work? How will you distribute each other's content, if applicable? How will you give credit?

"I encourage folks to do that and think through as many of those things as they can at the beginning so that you're not building the plane while it's in the air as much as possible," Murray says.
