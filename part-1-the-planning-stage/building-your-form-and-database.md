# Building your form and database

ProPublica is working with Google to develop a turnkey solution that you can use to build your own project without having to start from scratch or hire a developer. It will be available later this year.

The foundation of the project is your tip submission form, so you need to think very carefully about what data points you need, the phrasing of your questions, and the terminology you use. We highly recommend doing sufficient pre-reporting and consulting with experts about those three points. We also recommend keeping the form brief and simple; if there are too many questions, people will give up before they finish.

Keep in mind that you can change the form later, but it's a bad idea to do so unless you are changing terminology. Adding questions or categories will give you an uneven data set.

At a minimum, you will likely want to capture: -The date, location and description of the thing that happened -The tipster's name and email -Space to include additional links or attachments

You should also consider any categories that you can use for filtering within the database. For example, DocHate allows tipsters to choose location type \(school, private property, etc\); reasons they were targeted, and whether they reported the incident to police.

You should also think carefully about the language on the page that comes before the form. Keep it brief, but be clear about what you plan to do with submissions and to ensure tipsters' privacy.
