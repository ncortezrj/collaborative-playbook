# MOUs and agreements

Some organizations opt to draft official agreements or memorandums of understanding when they embark on a collaboration. In some cases, newsrooms may decide on a legal accord; in other cases, they sign a non-binding MOU to set the terms of the partnership. Other times, the only thing partners draft in writing is the grant proposal.

ProPublica does not use MOUs or agreements for practical reasons, but some newsrooms do, so here are some examples of how others have done these.

One thing to keep in mind is setting reasonable expectations for newsroom partners of different sizes.

"It's figuring out how to set ground rules that creates a more level playing field rather than assuming we're all coming to this from the same place," says Friedman-Rudovsky. "So establishing mechanisms whether it's through the shared funding that we have or other ways that makes it feel like no matter what sort of resources your outlet brings, you are just as much of a valued member in this."
