# Is this a crowd-powered project?

When you're considering an idea for a collaborative crowd-powered data project, there are some questions you will want to consider. See the end of this report for a worksheet with a list of these questions you can fill out.

### **What question or questions do you want to answer?** 

It's important to consider what information you're hoping to get. It's not enough to define a topic you want to report on; you need to spell out exactly what you want to find out. For example, it's not useful to just say you want to report on an election. Some questions you can ask are: What kind of problems do voters face? Which groups of voters face the biggest hurdles to voting? What cities or states are experiencing serious voting problems?

The questions will ultimately shape the form you'll build to survey your audience.

### **Can this question be answered by surveying the public?** 

Keep in mind that crowdsourcing can be your main avenue of sourcing, but it can also be one of several.

You'll want to evaluate how you can gather the most complete data set or source pool possible. Would this be better accomplished through public records requests, existing data sets, or gathering news clips? Or would those be useful in addition to crowdsourcing? At a bare minimum, the value of crowdsourcing is to find people affected by the issue that can help illustrate the stories you tell using other data.

### **Who is your audience?** 

When we say audience in this instance, we mean the people you need to reach with your crowdsourcing form.

This is essentially an exercise in sourcing. Is your audience defined by geography? Shared experiences? Profession? Ethnicity? It may be more than one group; for example, you may want to reach eligible voters in Florida, or undocumented immigrants in detention. You must define this audience early on, after you define the questions you want to answer.

### **Is your reporting priority quantitative or qualitative?** 

In other words, do you aim to build a complete data set, or are you more concerned with unearthing trends and story ideas? If you have a quantitative priority, that might require additional branches of reporting and incorporating other sources, like public records. If you're hoping to get a broad overview of a topic -- to identify patterns and write compelling local or feature stories -- crowdsourcing can likely help you do that.

Here's the bottom line: crowdsourcing alone will let you do interesting stories, but it may not give you a complete data set.

### **Can you gather the information you need with a single structured set of questions?** 

The next thing to consider is if your ask is simple or condensed enough to fit into a single set of questions. That's important, because circulating more than one form will make your messaging harder, especially if you're working within a collaboration. Are their multiple audiences you want to reach that will require different sets of questions? If so, you may want to narrow it down to a single audience. When it comes to building a form, you'll want to keep it simple.

### **Do you need to distribute your tip form in more than one language?** 

When appropriate, it's a good idea to translate your tip form and distribute it in other languages. This makes sense when you are doing reporting across multiple countries or immigrant communities. You'll also need to find partners that can help you distribute the translated form to the appropriate community who speaks that language.

### Who is best equipped to report these tips out? 

There are a number of factors you'll want to consider: Which organizations cover and serve the communities you want to reach? Which organizations have expertise in reporting on this subject or community? Which journalists would be interested in and willing to do this kind of work?

You will want to partner with news organizations that are able to distribute the tip form to the audience you want to reach. That could be geographic or relate to specific communities. You'll also want to consider who would be most interested and best prepared to report these tips out.

That might mean local outlets covering local news, or journalists with expertise in that particular beat. But you also need to consider which news outlets are willing to collaborate, which can be a challenge for larger companies given the levels of hierarchy.

### What kind of stories will this effort likely produce? 

When considering partners, you should consider the most likely product outcomes from your data. Will the stories likely be text, audio, or video? Will they include visualizations? If the topic is particularly sensitive and tipsters will be hesitant to use their names or show their faces, video and broadcast may be a more challenging route.
