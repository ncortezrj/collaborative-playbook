# Tracking impact

You'll want to track several elements of your project: Number of tips and verified tips Number of stories produced Impact from stories Media coverage generated from the project

We're currently building a database that will make it possible to track the tips, but if you build your own, be sure to make tip tracking an integral part of the database. In the Documenting Hate database, it's easy to see tip totals and to update tips to show which are being worked on and which have been reported out.

Collaborations may involve one, several, or many stories, but no matter the case, it's a good idea to have a landing page where all the stories live with a description of the project and partners.

Make sure at least one person is in charge of tracking impact, which ranges from media coverage of the project and individual stories to responses from government officials to legislation. The Center for Investigative Reporting has a helpful glossary of what types of impact you can track.
