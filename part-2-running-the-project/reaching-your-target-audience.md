# Reaching your target audience

A successful, coordinated launch should result in a first batch of tips. But you'll want to remind people about the project so that you can receive tips on a regular basis. So it's important to remind partners to continually share the tip form on social media and to link to it in relevant stories, even if they're not sourced from the project. The tip submission form needs to be circulated regularly by partners and prominently linked to on partner sites.

You may also want to consider creative ways to reach communities in order to get more tips, such as handing out paper flyers at events or snail-mailing flyers, which we have tried. You could also experiment with sending postcards or putting up flyers.

For radio and broadcast partners, it's really useful to mention the project on air and direct people to the form, so it's useful to have a short link.
