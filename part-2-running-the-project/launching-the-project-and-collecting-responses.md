# Launching the project and collecting responses

It's important to coordinate a launch date with your partners so you can all publish your tip submission forms on the same day, as well as an article about the project and what you're hoping to achieve. What those articles look like is something you can coordinate with your partners.

Once you settle on a format for launch stories, be sure to coordinate press outreach and social media/newsletter distribution. Creating buzz about the project will help get more eyeballs on your tip form.

As part of that outreach effort, identify organizations and people who care about this particular issue and who might be willing to spread the word about the project and have access to the communities you need to reach.
