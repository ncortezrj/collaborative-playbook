# Incorporating call-outs into reporting

There are several effective ways to incorporate the tip form into stories that are produced from the project, or are related to the project.

First, any time you or a partner produce a story relevant to the topic of the project, be sure to either write a prominent call-out to the form that links to it, or embed the form itself at the bottom of the story. Ditto for including an on-air call-out pointing people to the form online.

When stories relevant to the project are shared on social media, consider composing a thread \(which can even just be two tweets\) in which you promote the tip form in the second or subsequent tweets after the initial story.

When you or partners produce reporting from the project, it's important that the project is referenced, and you can link back to the tip form in those mentions, too.

When there's breaking news about the project, you and your partners should consider sharing information about the project on social media with a call-out to the tip form.

And while monitoring social media posts about the project or its reporting, be sure to follow up with commenters leaving tips in the comments, pointing them to the tip submission form.

In short, the more often you get the form in front of potential tipsters, the more likely you are to receive a steady stream of tips. And tipsters tend to respond to stories that they recognize in their own experiences, which is why it's important to make it easy for readers to submit tips after reading/listening to/watching a story.
