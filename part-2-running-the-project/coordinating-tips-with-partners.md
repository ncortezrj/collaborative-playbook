# Coordinating tips with partners

The important thing that participants of this type of project need to keep in mind is that their success depends on both their responsiveness and their willingness to share a pooled resource.

Our crowd-powered projects work based on a few principles: It's an exclusivity-free zone. Tips are given on a first-come, first-served basis. Tips that arrive through a specific media organization are given as first dibs to that media organization. Only one newsroom can work on a given tip at a time; more than two people should not be calling the same tipster. Tips can be revisited later, but only after the original journalist is finished reporting it out or attempting to contact the tipster. Contact information is only visible if the tip came in through your organization. \(For example, you'll only see tipster contact information for tips that came in through BuzzFeed. For all other tips, you won't be able to see contact information.\)

In the case of Documenting Hate, there's a partner manager to play traffic cop, manage the tips, and give out contact information for tipsters. If everyone has access to tipster contact information, the onus is on the participants to respect the first-come, first-served rule and to check with the person who already claimed dibs on a given tip.

Our database is set up so that reporters can see who is working on which tips, which tips have already been verified, and which haven't been reported on yet. There's also a space for reporters to put notes in more detail about what information they've gathered. This is really important for keeping track of progress on tips.

Occasionally, there are breaking tips that multiple people want to jump on. Usually the way that plays out is the first one to request to work on the tip publishes it first, and other outlets then might cite them or do their own separate reporting.

If you'd prefer to come up with a different system for claiming tips, just make sure that everyone is on board from the beginning.

It's also important to strike the right balance in communicating with partners about the project and ongoing reporting.

"It's respecting the fact that these folks are really busy and that for them to pay attention to what's going on, communication has to be easy and streamlined and direct," says Friedman-Rudovsky. "It has to be sort of enough information for them to know what's going on but not too much so that they feel overwhelmed and burdened by that."
