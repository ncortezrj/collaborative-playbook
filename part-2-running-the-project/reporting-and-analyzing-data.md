# Reporting and analyzing data

Depending on your data set, it's important to make clear to participants about the completeness of the data and how to refer to it.

If your data set is solely tips you've collected from the public, you'll need to make clear to participants a few things.

The data isn't all-encompassing. That means data isn't ripe for statistical analysis, or comparable over time. Tips are just tips until they are verified by journalists, so it's a good idea to be cautious about how you cite numbers from the database, especially until you reach a critical mass of responses.

If you're importing or adding data from other sources, it's possible you'll be closer to a more complete data set, in which numbers 1 and 2 may not apply.

The important point here is to make sure all of the participants understand the limitations of the data and how to refer to it.

If your data set is limited solely to crowdsourced tips, there are several approaches to reporting. Report individual tips as standalone stories. This is particularly useful when you're working with local media outlets. Identify patterns in the data and report out as many tips as possible that are part of that pattern. Use the database to identify sources for stories you're already working on.
