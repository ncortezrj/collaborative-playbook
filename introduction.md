# Introduction: What Is Collaborative Journalism?

Collaborative journalism is the practice of two or more newsrooms working together on a story, a series of stories, a reporting project, or a data set. Collaborations may also include newsrooms working with non-media entities, like universities, non-profits, researchers, or libraries.

Collaborations allow multiple newsrooms to tell a larger number of stories, reach different audiences, make the most out of large data sets, and ultimately, have important impact.

These types of collaborations come together for a variety of reasons.

Some are formed through necessity, such as connecting small newsrooms together, like Coast Alaska, or strengthening ties between local affiliates. Some collaborations focus on a topic, like the Broke in Philly collaboration about economic mobility in Philadelphia.

Other collaborations arise around troves of data. The Panama Papers and Paradise Papers investigations were possible thanks to huge document leaks. And some collaborations center on an event, like ProPublica's Electionland project to track voting problems in real time.

The Center for Collaborative Journalism, which studies these types of projects, defines six types of collaborations:

* Temporary and Separate 
* Temporary and Co-creating 
* Temporary and Integrated 
* Ongoing and Separate 
* Ongoing and Co-creating 
* Ongoing and Integrated

In other words, collaborations run the gamut from independently reporting stories within a coalition, to working together to report stories, to sharing resources to report separately. And while some collaborations may last for a limited period of time, others may be long term.

The Center has a database of close to 200 different collaborative projects from around the world that shows the diversity and creativity of these types of endeavors.
