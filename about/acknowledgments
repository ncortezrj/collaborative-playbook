Many thanks to our hundreds of newsroom partners we've worked with on Electionland and Documenting Hate who have done excellent reporting and helped make these projects successful. We'd like to thank the Center for Cooperative Media for holding its annual Collaborative Journalism Summit, which is always a source of inspiration and ideas. And last but not least, we're very grateful to the Google News Initiative, which made this report possible, and to our collaborative project funders, including Google and Open Society Foundations.
