## About the Documenting Hate project

Documenting Hate is a collaborative, crowd-powered project launched by ProPublica in January 2017 to investigate hate crimes and bias incidents in the United States. More than 160 newsrooms are partners, as well as nearly 20 college newspapers and various journalism schools. To date, the project has collected nearly 6,000 tips and journalists have produced nearly 200 stories.

## About the Tool We're Building

We're building a turnkey database called Collaborate, which will let newsrooms set up their own crowd-powered projects that should be ready in mid-2019. [Sign up here to receive an alert when it is launched](https://propublica.forms.fm/documenting-hate-tool-sign-up).
